tikettijärjestelmän web-käyttöliittymä. Web-käyttöliittymä on toteutettu Angularilla. Web-käyttöliittymä kommunikoi erikseen asennettavan tikettijärjestelmän rajapinnan Tukki-backend kanssa. Web-käyttöliittymän arkkitehtuurin kuvaus.\nAsennus\nWeb-käyttöliittymä tarvitsee toimiakseen tikettijärjestelmän rajapinnan Tukki-backend. Katso ohjeet sen asentamiseksi projektin GitHub sivulta. Sieltä löytyy myös ohjeet tämän web-käyttöliittymän ajamiseen yhdessä rajapinnan kanssa.\nKehitysympäristö\nAlla on ohjeet miten käytät tätä projektia kehitystyössä. Ohjeet olettavat sinun asentaneen tikettijärjestelmän rajapinnan sen ohjeiden mukaan.\nAsennus kehitysympäristössä\n\nAsenna nodejs ja npm tietokoneellesi.\nAsenna Angular-CLI globaalisti npm:llä komennolla npm install -g @angular/cli\nLataa tai kloonaa tämä repo. Aseta tikettijärjestelmän rajapinnassa ympäristömuuttuja FRONTEND_DIRECTORY osoittamaan kyseisessä kansiossa olevaan /dist/tikettisysteemi -hakemistoon. Esimerkiksi FRONTEND_DIRECTORY=/home/user/UKK-tiketit/dist/tikettisysteemi/\nAja komento npm ci asentaaksesi projektin riippuvuudet\nAja komento npm run build kääntääksesi projektin.\n\nKääntäminen\nAja komento npm run build kääntääksesi projektin production versiona.\nAja komento npm run watch, jos haluat tehdä kehitystyötä. Tällöin projekti käännetään development versiona ja kääntäminen tapahtuu tiedostojen muuttumisen yhteydessä.\nProjektin käännetty versio sijaitsee dist/tikettisysteemi/ hakemistossa.\nTestien ajaminen\nAja komento ng test ajaaksesi kaikki projektin testit Karmalla. Testit sijaitsevat *.spec.ts -tiedostoissa jokaisen komponentin, servicen ja pipen yhteydessä.\nTestejä voi ajaa myös testitiedosto kerrallaan käyttäen --include argumenttia. Esimerkiksi SubmitTicketComponent testit voi ajaa komennolla ng test --include **/submit-ticket.component.spec.ts\nTestit ajetaan käyttäen Google Chrome -selainta. Joissain tapauksissa testiympäristö ei havaitse automaattisesti Chromen binaaria ja tällöin joudut asettamaan ympäristömuuttujan CHROME_BIN. Esimerkiksi CHROME_BIN=chromium ng test.\nProjektiin on myös määritelty production testien ajaminen ng test:prod komennolla, joka ajaa testit flageilla --browsers=ChromeHeadless --watch=false --code-coverage. Tämä komento on tarkoitettu lähinnä automaattisten testien ajamiseen.\nHyödyllisiä linkkejä\n\nWeb-käyttöliittymän käyttöohjeet\nTikettijärjestelmän REST rajapinta\nAngular - Angular coding style guide\nAngular Material UI component library\nAngular - Testing\nTesting Angular - A Guide to Robust Angular Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2022 Joni Rajala\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

ylläpitäjälle. \nTämän kuvauksen ymmärtämiseksi olisi hyvä tuntea perustiedot Angularin\nyleisistä käsitteistä, kuten moduuli (module tai ngModule), \nkomponentti (component), template ja service.  Näistä voi lukea esimerkiksi Angularin virallisesta dokumentaatiosta. Tiedostojen nimissä käytetään Angularin suosituksia.\nTekniikat\nTämän frontendin tekemisessä käytettyjä tekniikoita. Suurin osa näistä tulee Angularin mukana.\n\nAngular Framework. Tätä kirjoittaessa major-versio on uusin 16.\nHTML - Templatien määrittely.\nSASS/SCSS - CSS:n esikäsittelykieli, jolla tehdyt tyylitiedostot kääntyvät CSS:ksi.\nTypeScript - JavaScriptin superset tyyppimäärityksillä.\nRxJS - Kirjasto reaktiivisen ohjelmoinnin toteuttamiseen käyttäen observableja.\nAngular Material - Komponenttikirjasto käyttöliittymäelementteille.\nAngular Router - Reititys ja navigointi.\nAngular CLI - Komentorivityökalu.\nAngular Reactive Forms - Reaktiivisten lomakkeiden tekemiseen.\nNgxEditor - Rich-text editori -komponentti.\nNpm - Riippuvuuksien hallintaan.\nJasmine - Testaus framework yksikkötesteillle.\nKarma - Testien suoritusympäristö, joka toimii Jasminen kanssa.\nGit - versionhallinta.\nESLint - Staattinen koodinanalyysi.\n\nModuulit\nSovellus koostuu eri moduuleista. App.module on juurimoduuli, joka sijaitsee hakemistossa /src/app. Siellä on alihakemistot muille moduuleille.\nModuulit sisältävät tyypillisesti seuraavat tiedostot:\n\n*.module.ts. - Moduulin määritykset lukuunottamatta reitityksen määrittelyjä.\n*.module.routing.ts - Moduulin tarjoamia reitityksen määrittelyjä.\n*.models.ts - Moduulissä käytettyjä malleja, tyypillisesti rajapintoja.\n*.service.ts - Moduulissa käytetty service.\n*.spec.ts - Automaattitestejä.\n*.dummydata.ts - Testien käyttämää dataa.\nKomponentteja, jotka ovat omissa alihakemistoissaan.\n\nSovellus koostuu seuraavista moduuleista\napp.module\n\nSovelluksen päämoduuli, jossa myös määritellään muut moduulit.\n\ncore.module\n\nSovelluksen ydintoiminnallisuus. Importoidaan vain app.modulessa, jolloin se voidaan pitää yksinkertaisempana. \n  Sisältää:\nApp.modulen käyttämiä komponentteja, kuten header ja footer ja näkymäkomponentteja, kuten home, Ei oikeuksia ja Sivua ei löytynyt.\nYleisiä servicejä, kuten auth.service ja error.service.\nhttp-interceptor.ts, joka logittaa HTTP-kutsuja.\n\nFeature -moduulit\n  Muu sovelluksen toiminnallisuus on ryhmitelty näihin moduuleihin. Jokainen shared.modulea lukuunottamatta sisältää niiden toiminnallisuudesta vastaavan servicen sekä reitityksen määrittelyt.\n\nticket.module - Tiketteihin eli kysymyksiin liittyviä toiminnallisuus,\n  kuten tikettien listaus, tikettien ja UKK:n näyttäminen ja käsittely.\n\nuser.module - Käyttäjiin liittyviä toiminnallisuus, kuten kirjautumisnäkymä,\n  käyttäprofiilien näyttäminen ja käsittely.\n\ncourse.module - Kursseihin liittyviä toiminnallisuus, kuten kursseille liittyminen, sekä kurssiasetusten- ja tikettipohjien käsittely.\n\n\nshared.module\n  Sisältää uudelleenkäytettäviä ominaisuuksia, joita käytetään muissa moduuleissa. Yleisten Material -teemaan kuuluvien moduulien tuonti on jaettu omaksi material.module -tiedostoksi. Sisältää monia eri näkymien käyttämiä komponentteja, kuten editor ja sender-info, sekä pipeja ja Reactive Forms -direktiivejä.\nKomponentit\nKukin komponentti vastaa tietystä käyttöliittymän osasta. App.module sisältää juurikomponentin AppComponent, joka toimii sovelluksen näkymän perustana ja\njohon reitityksestä riippuen renderöidään sitä vastaava näkymäkomponentti.\nNäiden komponenttien lisäksi on rajatummasta käyttöliittymän osasta vastaavia komponentteja, kuten header tai\ntiketin kommentti. Komponentit voivat sisältää muita komponentteja. Komponentit kuuluvat tiettyyn moduuliin ja sijaitsevat niiden hakemistossa omassa alihakemistossaan.\nKomponentteihin hakemistot sisältävät yleensä seuraavat tiedostot:\n\n*.component.ts - Komponentin määrittely sekä sen TypeScript -luokka, joka käsittelee komponentin näyttämisessä tarvittavaa logiikkaa.\n*.component.html - Komponenttiin liitetty template, jonka mukaan komponentin näkymä renderöidään. \n*.component.scss - Templatessa käytetyt SCSS / SASS -tyylimäärittelyt.\n*.component.spec.ts - Komponentin Jasmine -testit.\n\nServicet\nSisältävät toiminnallisuuksia, jotka eivät suoraan liity näytettävään käyttöliittymään. Kaikki yhteydenpito backendiin tapahtuu serviceissä. Yleiset servicet ovat hakemistossa /src/app/core/services, joiden lisäksi feature-moduuleilla on kullakin omansa shared.modulea lukuunottamatta. Servicet ovat *.service.ts -tiedostoissa. Samassa hakemistossa on myös vastaava\n*.service.spec.ts - tiedosto, jossa on servicen testit.\nEri servicet ja ja niiden vastuualueet\nauth.service\nKäyttäjäautentikaatioon liittyvät toiminnot, kuten kirjautuminen ja sen jälkeen\ntapahtuva käyttäjätietojen hakeminen palvelimelta sekä käyttäjätilin luominen.\nstore.service\nTänne tallennetaan ja palautetaan muistissa olevia globaaleja muuttujia, kuten\ntieto kirjautumisesta ja käyttäjätiedoista. Sisältää myös vakioita. Tämä tila haetaan uudestaan reitityksen muuttuessa eikä tallenneta sessioiden välilä. Sessioiden yli säilyvää tila tallennetaan local storageen. Komponenttien ja niiden lapsien tai vanhempien välinen tiedonvaihto käydään suoraan niiden välillä. Tällä servicellä voidaan välittää tieto minkä tahansa komponenttien ja serviceiden välillä.\nerror.service\nServiceissä tapahtuvat virheet ohjataan ensin tänne, jossa ne logitetaan console.log:lla. 403 eli Ei oikeuksia -virhetilanteissa reititetäänä täältä sitä vastaavaan virhenäkymään. Virheet heitetään uudelleen, jolloin komponentit voivat napata ne ja esittää ne tarvittaessa käyttäjälle tai tehdä muita toimia. Servicellä on mahdollista myös testausta varten generoida virheitä. HTTP-kutsuja logittaa http-interceptor.\nutils.service\nYleishyödyllisiä funktioita, jotka eivät suoraan liity toisten serviceiden vastuualueeseen.\nFeature-moduulien servicet\nticket.service\nKäsittelee tiketteihin eli kysymyksiin liittyviä toiminnallisuuksia, kuten tikettien ja niiden kommenttien ja liitetiedostojen käsittely.\ncourse.service\nKäsittelee kursseihin liittyviä toiminnallisuuksia, kuten kurssienhakeminen, tikettipohjien käsittely ja kurssien tietojen tuonti ja vienti tiedostoiksi.\nuser.service\nTeema ja tyylit\nSovellus käyttää Angular Material -kirjaston kustomoitua teemaa, jonka määrittelyt ovat tiedostossa src/styles/custom-theme.scss. Globaalit tyylimäärittelyt ovat tiedostossa src/styles.scss. Se sisältää kaikkialla sovelluksessa käytettyjä CSS -luokkia, joiden nimet ovat .theme- -alkuisia. Komponenttikohtaiset tyylit ovat määritelty komponenttien\n.component.scss -tiedostoissa.\nKieli ja käännökset\nAngularissa käännökset voidaan natiivisti tehdä kahdella eri tavalla: yleisemmin build-aikana tai ajonaikaisesti. Tässä sovelluksessa\nnoudatetaan jälkimmäistä tapaa. Kieli haetaan ja alustetaan ohjelman käynnistyessä tiedostossa src/app/app.initializers.ts. Käännöksen vaihtaminen ajon aikana aiheuttaa aina sovelluksen uudelleenkäynnistyksen.\nTämä on normaalia. Englanninkieliset käännökset sijaitsevat\ntiedostossa src/assets/en-US.json. Käännökset ovat muodossa:\n  \"Suomenkielinen käännösavain\": \"Englanninkielinen käännös\"\nSuomenkielinen, alkuperäinen teksti on komponenttien templateissa tai komponentin koodissa. Käännös haetaan käännösavaimeen viittaamalla. Komponentin koodissa tämä tapahtuu $localize -funktiolla.\nProjektin hakemistorakenne\n\nangular.json - Angularin asetuksia. Mm. eri tiedostojen sijaintien määrittely.\npackage.json - Node.js -asetukset, kuten npm skriptien määrittelyt ja pakettiriippuvuudet.\n/src/ - Sovelluksen lähdekoodi.\n/app/ - App.modulen hakemisto. Sisältää muiden moduulien alihakemistot.\n/styles/ - Custom teeman tyylimäärittelyt.\nassets/ - Logot, ikonit ja käännökset.\nmain.ts - Täällä asetettu, että production buildissa ei näytetä logeja.\nindex.html - Sovelluksen title, fonttien, faviconin osoitteet, sekä mitä\nnäytetään, jos ei selaimessa JavaScript -käytössä.\nenvironments/ - Environment -variablet. Sisältää sovelluksen nimen ja base URL:n. Tiedostot:\nenvironments.ts - Development build:lle.\nenvironments.prod.ts - Production build:lle.\n\n\n\n\n\nVianmääritys\nTarkkaile virheilmoituksia selainkonsolissa / browser console. Developer buildissa myös tavalliset console.log -logitukset ovat käytössä, joista voi olla hyötyä.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
