tikettijärjestelmän web-käyttöliittymä. Web-käyttöliittymä on toteutettu Angularilla. Web-käyttöliittymä kommunikoi erikseen asennettavan tikettijärjestelmän rajapinnan Tukki-backend kanssa.\nAsennus\nWeb-käyttöliittymä tarvitsee toimiakseen tikettijärjestelmän rajapinnan Tukki-backend. Katso ohjeet sen asentamiseksi projektin GitHub sivulta. Sieltä löytyy myös ohjeet tämän web-käyttöliittymän ajamiseen yhdessä rajapinnan kanssa.\nKehitysympäristö\nAlla on ohjeet miten käytät tätä projektia kehitystyössä. Ohjeet olettavat sinun asentaneen tikettijärjestelmän rajapinnan sen ohjeiden mukaan.\nAsennus kehitysympäristössä\n\nAsenna nodejs ja npm tietokoneellesi.\nAsenna Angular-CLI globaalisti npm:llä komennolla npm install -g @angular/cli\nLataa tai kloonaa tämä repo. Aseta tikettijärjestelmän rajapinnassa ympäristömuuttuja FRONTEND_DIRECTORY osoittamaan kyseisessä kansiossa olevaan /dist/tikettisysteemi -hakemistoon. Esimerkiksi FRONTEND_DIRECTORY=/home/user/UKK-tiketit/dist/tikettisysteemi/\nAja komento npm ci asentaaksesi projektin riippuvuudet\nAja komento npm run build kääntääksesi projektin.\n\nKääntäminen\nAja komento npm run build kääntääksesi projektin production versiona.\nAja komento npm run watch, jos haluat tehdä kehitystyötä. Tällöin projekti käännetään development versiona ja kääntäminen tapahtuu tiedostojen muuttumisen yhteydessä.\nProjektin käännetty versio sijaitsee dist/tikettisysteemi/ hakemistossa.\nTestien ajaminen\nAja komento ng test ajaaksesi kaikki projektin testit Karmalla. Testit sijaitsevat *.spec.ts -tiedostoissa jokaisen komponentin, servicen ja pipen yhteydessä.\nTestejä voi ajaa myös testitiedosto kerrallaan käyttäen --include argumenttia. Esimerkiksi SubmitTicketComponent testit voi ajaa komennolla ng test --include **/submit-ticket.component.spec.ts\nTestit ajetaan käyttäen Google Chrome -selainta. Joissain tapauksissa testiympäristö ei havaitse automaattisesti Chromen binaaria ja tällöin joudut asettamaan ympäristömuuttujan CHROME_BIN. Esimerkiksi CHROME_BIN=chromium ng test.\nProjektiin on myös määritelty production testien ajaminen ng test:prod komennolla, joka ajaa testit flageilla --browsers=ChromeHeadless --watch=false --code-coverage. Tämä komento on tarkoitettu lähinnä automaattisten testien ajamiseen.\nHyödyllisiä linkkejä\n\nWeb-käyttöliittymän käyttöohjeet\nTikettijärjestelmän REST rajapinta\nAngular - Angular coding style guide\nAngular Material UI component library\nAngular - Testing\nTesting Angular - A Guide to Robust Angular Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2022 Joni Rajala\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

komponentti\n(component), template ja service.  Näistä voi lukea esimerkiksi Angularin virallisesta dokumentaatiosta. Tiedostojen nimissä käytetään Angularin suosituksia.\nModuulit\nSovellus koostuu erilaisista moduuleista. Sisältävät tyypillisesti seuraavat tiedostot:\n*.module.ts. - Moduulin asetukset lukuunottamatta routing-asetuksia.\n*.module.routing.ts - Routing -asetukset.\n*.models.ts - Moduulissä käytettyjä modeleja, tyypillisesti rajapintoja.\n*.service.ts - Moduulissa käytetty service.\n.spec.ts - Jasmine -automaattitestit.\ndummydata.ts - Testien käyttämää dummydataa.\nTämä sovellus koostuu app ja core moduuleista sekä eri feature-moduuleista:\n\napp.module\n\nSovelluksen päämoduuli. Sisältää juurikomponentin AppComponent, joka toimii sovelluksen näkymän perustana. \nMääritellään kaikki muut moduulit.\nOtetaan käynnistyksessä käyttöön haluttu kieli funktiolla initializeLanguage.\n\n\ncore.module\n\nSovelluksen ydintoiminnallisuus.\nYleisiä komponentteja, kuten header ja footer.\nYleisiä näkymiä ja virhenäkymiä.\nMonia yleiskäyttöisiä servicejä, kuten auth.service.\n\n\nFeature -moduulit\nNämä ovat tapa ryhmitellä toisiinsa liittyvää toiminnallisuutta. Jokainen moduuli shared.modulea lukuunottamatta sisältää niiden toiminnallisuudesta vastaavan servicen sekä routing määrittelyt tiedostoissa *.routing.module.ts.\n\nticket.module\n\nSisältää tiketteihin eli kysymyksiin liittyviä ominaisuuksia.\n\n\nuser.module\n\nSisältää käyttäjiin liittyviä ominaisuuksia.\n\n\ncourse.module\n\nSisältää kursseihin liittyviä ominaisuuksia.\n\n\nshared.module\n\nOmainaisuuksia, joita on käytössä useissa eri feature-moduuleissa.\n\n\n\nKomponentit\nTähän komponenteista.\nServicet\nTähän serviceistä.\nTeema ja tyylit\nSovellus käyttää tyylien määrittelyyn SASS-kirjastoa ja sen Sassy CSS eli SCSS -määrittelytapaa. Tyylit ovat .scss -tiedostoissa. Sovellus käyttää Angular Material -kirjastoa ja kustomoitua teemaa, jonka tyyliasetukset ovat tiedostossa src/styles/custom-theme.scss. Globaalit tyylimäärittelyt ovat tiedostossa src/styles.scss. Täällä määrittelyt css -classien nimet ovat tyypillisesti \".theme-\" -alkuisia. Suurin osa tyyleistä on määritelty komponenteissa .scss -tiedostoissa.\nMuut tiedostot\nsrc/assets sisältää hakemistot ikoneille ja logoille sekä käännöstiedoston en-US.json. Käännökset ovat muodossa:\n\"Suomenkielinen käännösavain\": \"Englanninkielinen käännös\"\nSuomenkielinen teksti on komponenttien templateissa. Käännös haetaan käännösavaimeen viittaamalla. Käännös tehdäään ajonaikaisesti. Käännöksen vaihtaminen ajon aikana aiheuttaa sovelluksen uudelleenkäynnistyksen.\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
